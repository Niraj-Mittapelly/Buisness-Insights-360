## Company’s back ground

The company AltiQ Hardware has expanded significantly in recent years and has operations across the globe. This corporation uses three different channels to offer computers and computer accessories.

The company recently suffered an unanticipated loss when it opened a store in America. This decision was made based on surveys, gut feeling, and some Excel analysis. Additionally, the company's competitors have a small number of analytics teams who do analysis and make data-driven decisions. Thus, AltiQ Hardware's only remaining choice to improve its industry survival is to expand its analytics staff in order to make data-driven decisions and insights in the future. 

## Data importing into PowerBi

Since this project uses a MySQL database, we must import the datasets from the database into PowerBi by entering the database access credentials.

## Data Model

- Data modelling is important and is regarded as the report's foundation. The data model will serve as the foundation for every graphic.
- Report performance is impacted overall by poor data modelling.
It is imperative to adhere to best practices for data modelling. Check out this website to learn about the best practices. [Weblog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
